# YARS
Yet Another RAG Script

The main goal of this project is to share a light-weight but powerful and open-source base for people to ingest PDF files and find information directly by asking questions. The core components of this chatbot are **nvidia** and **langchain** libraries, both **free** to use! The main advantage of this implementation is the possibility to choose from a list of different **LLM** models hosted by NVIDIA.

**YARS** will continue to grow with more functionality, with the target audience being the scientific community. I'll write more about my personal short- and long-term goals of this *chatbot* soon :)

## Execution
` python main_yars.py -d [path_to_pdf_file | path_to_PDFs_folder]`
